<h1>Paragraph Practice</h1>


<p> the words "the funi" started being used in 2022 by a person named "halls_oftreachery" and it is believed he was the man who started it all.
although there isnt any proof, people still believe it.  the funi appears to have the word funny shortened by removing one n and changing the y to an i.
it is most likely used to represent a moment that, would indeed be funny. although no cases show him saying it in most of those situations.
in fact he says it randomly too.</p>


<p>


right now we cannot speak to this person as they are constantly doing work. no matter if its school or not.  we possibly will when he takes a break but we dont know when that is.


</p>



<p>	currently he doesnt have a lot left to do before he is free. but its best not to come to him the moment he takes a break.
